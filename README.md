### The Challenge
Traditional loyalty programs often lack engagement and struggle to connect customers with businesses across different industries. In the UK alone, the market for rewards programs was valued at a staggering US$8.18 billion in 2023. Businesses need a solution to create a more rewarding experience for customers. Though some of the businesses, especially small and medium ones, do not have talent and knowledge to implement technology by themselves.

### The Solution: Expanding Loyalty Networks with Blockchain
Blockchain technology offers a revolutionary solution for loyalty programs. It allows businesses to collaborate and create a network where customers can earn and redeem rewards across various industries.
Here's how it works:
- Local Business Collaborations: Imagine a gym partnering with a healthy restaurant and a yoga studio. Customers earn points at the gym that they can redeem for post-workout meals or relaxing yoga sessions. This expands the reward network and benefits both businesses and customers.
- City-Wide Programs: Imagine a program where customers earn points for using public transportation, shopping locally, and dining out. These points can then be redeemed for discounts or other exciting rewards. This promotes a more sustainable and vibrant city environment while encouraging local business engagement.
- Cross-Industry Partnerships: A pet store could partner with a veterinarian and a pet grooming service. Customers earn rewards at the store that can be used for check-ups, vaccinations, or professional grooming sessions, creating a seamless and convenient experience for pet owners.

#### Why We Stand Out: AR Ads and Easy Onboarding
While blockchain offers a powerful solution, it can be intimidating for some customers, especially after a number of scammers using NFTs over the years. This is where our expertise in AR technology comes in. We can create a more engaging onboarding experience by leveraging AR-powered billboards without making it too heavy for customers and businesses to comprehend. Imagine bus stops transformed into interactive loyalty hubs! Commuters can point their phones at an AR billboard to see a captivating 3D animation showcasing local businesses participating in the program. This animation highlights exclusive rewards and allows users to download the app directly, seamlessly starting their blockchain loyalty journey. This innovative approach simplifies user acquisition and program enrolment, making blockchain technology more approachable for everyone.
By combining the power of expanding loyalty networks with blockchain and the user-friendly experience of AR advertising, we offer a unique and compelling solution for the future of loyalty programs uniting local businesses based on location, their target audience, their values sharing a wider pool of more loyal customers.

## Technical explanation

For the proof of concept, we used the Moonbeam parachain to deploy EVM compatible smart contracts (in this case an Open Zeppelin implementation of an ERC-721compatible NFT). We also used the local Moonbeam Development Node to quickly iterate on the blockchain solution.
We also experimented with using Moralis to provide a frictionless authentication solution to the platform. However, due to time constraints and issues with the Firebase plugin, we could not complete it.
In the future, we may implement our solution as a completely independent parachain to have more flexibility.
